# 👋 Yoo, I’m Mahin! 🚀

Welcome to my corner of the internet.

## 🚀 Who Am I?

I’m a  **Full Stack Developer** who loves building things for the web.  
Frontend, backend, cloud, DevOps — I mess with it all. ⚡

## 🧰 My Arsenal of Doom

- 🖥️ **Languages:** JavaScript | TypeScript  
- ⚛️ **Frontend:** React | Next.js  
- 🔥 **Backend:** Node.js | Express | gRPC  
- 📦 **Containerization:** Docker  
- ☁️ **Cloud:** AWS  
- ⚙️ **DevOps:** CI/CD (because why deploy manually when you can automate your chaos?)  
- 📊 **Monitoring:** Grafana | Prometheus  
- 🐙 **Version Control:** Git | GitHub

## ✨ Fun Facts

- I talk to my terminal like it’s a sentient being.  
- My Docker containers are better organized than my room.  
- My code sometimes works on the first try. (I know, I'm scared too.)  
- I once debugged a bug at 3 AM that turned out to be a missing comma. Legendary.
- My CI/CD pipelines never break (well... almost 😅).

## 💡 Life Philosophy

> *"In a world of undefined variables, be the null that breaks the system.."*

Or at least, consistently push to `main` without breaking the build.
